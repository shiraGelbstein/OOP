1. Whatever Player :
     The strategy is compliantly random, choosing randomly out of the board
     coordinates and marking.

  Clever Player :
    The strategy was for the 55% of the times (randomly choosing 0-100 number and checking its value)
    using the whatever player and than for the rest acting like the genius.

  Genius Player :
    the strategy is marking in the most unfilled row in the board in the most left column.
    that way the genius will (almost) always fill a line and than the clever will fill another
    line and so on until they finish size of the board rounds and starting over that the genius
    fills its lines and the clever the rest after him.
    or if clever starts it wont always play as the genius and will get random acting which satisfies
    the behavior supplied in ex1 instructions.

2.  The advantage of a shared interface for the players is being able of programming
    A game between players without needing to know exactly which one of the players we are using,
    only at run time! that way we are voiding cod duplication and having a readable cod.
    moreover if we want to add other players we will only need the class of the new player
    to have the same interface as the other players without changing the game's Api.
    these advantages are  exactly what we called the polymorphism
